It's amazing how time flies!  I have 25 years of development experience.  I started in VB4 and now I'm doing Full Stack Development in React/Node/Express!  I've seen the good times in this field and the not-so-good times.  But overall I'm still here learning!  I have a passion for technology and coding, but now I really want to branch out into how I can help devs be successful.  Yes, I would like to be a tech dev manager someday!  But in the mean time I'm always looking to mentor people and help my team mates become better devs.<br/>

I'm currently working in Angular/Typescript with a C# API and SQL Server database.  But I'm learning React with Node/Express as the API!  The more things change the more things are the same.  Back in the day, learning a new language would take weeks (if not months), now things are getting a lot easier!  Although I work just as hard as I did when I was a new dev, the information and examples have just gotten SO MUCH BETTER!  My most recent experience is with learning React by consuming a 9 hour YouTube video and creating a simple SPA hosted on AWS in just under a week!  <br/>

Fun Fact: My 1st job out of college was being QA!  I had a lot of good mentors back then.  But one manager took me under his wing and allowed me to become the dev that I was meant to be.  He bought me VB books and allowed me to write my 1st <b>PAID</b> application!  My goal of that application was to make my QA job easier and ultimately that tool eliminated that position altogether!  My comment that I wrote for that application was something like: "I'm sorry, but this is my 1st real application...  Please update it!".

I've worked in the following technologies over the years:
C#, SQL, JS, TS, Angular, Vue, React, WPF, MVVM, MVC
